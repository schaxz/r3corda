# 5) Final Thoughts

Corda is trying to solve the problem of privacy when it comes to B2B transactions. How does one preserve competitive secrets while also being able to conduct trustless immutable business transactions. Businesses need to be able to trust their vendors and suppliers and vice versa without having to resort to a middleman, and that is what the Corda's financial ledger allows them to do. The privacy of the IOU's (financial promises to one another) is preserved as other parties not involved in the transaction have no visibility over it. The notary is the only node with visibility to ensure all parties behave and follow validation rules.

R3 believes a solution like Corda is superior to using public chains like Ethereum with Zero-Knowledge Proofs added on, a la Ernst&Young's implementation of NightFall. With higher throughput and better scalability, since there is no mathematical and/ or hardware overhead that ZK Proofs require, it is hard to argue against such a notion.

This engineering exercise, helped me learn how an enterprise grade distributed systems is modularized and tested. 

I am curious to see what sorts of TPS Corda can reach, when running at max capacity.
